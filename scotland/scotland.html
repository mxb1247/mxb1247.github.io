        <p>
          When I got off the train at Edinburgh, Scotland I started walking up the street and saw Edinburgh Castle at the top of the mountain. The castle was so breathtaking that I had to stand for a moment to take it all in. Once I got my ticket and entered the castle I felt like I was immediately transported to a scene in Game of Thrones, it was amazing. I had time to explore the castle and came across the royal jewels exhibit where I saw the kings crown and sword, it was such an incredible experience.

         <p>
           The food in Edinburgh is still to this day the best food that I have ever eaten. No matter what restaurant the food was never disappointing. During the day I stumbled upon a cute restaurant at the end of one of the streets. I felt like I was transported to medieval times, the walls were cover in brick and all the decor looked like it came out of an old medieval castle. When I got my food, and took a bite, I was blown away. The flavors were something that I have never had before. The food was so good I even went ahead and ordered seconds.  Whether you are in the mood for meat, carbs, or desert Edinburgh got you covered and trust me it’s worth it.

       <section id="scotlandstreet"><h2>The Streets of Edinburgh, Scotland</h2>

        <p>
          When I arrived in Edinburgh, Scotland I started walking towards Edinburgh’s old town. The street was filled with people, quaint shops, great food, and amazing churches. I continued walking up to the street and saw an unbelievable sight of Edinburgh Castle. It was breathtaking. When I finally made it to the top I looked over the side of the mountain and saw miles and miles of Scotland, it was amazing.

      <section id="edinburghview"><h2>Edinburgh, Scotland</h2>

        <p>
          The train ride from London to Edinburgh is about a four-and-a-half-hour trip with views of the beautiful scenery of London’s countryside. The views were breathtaking, like a fairy tale story. When I finally arrived in Edinburgh, Scotland I was amused. Edinburgh is filled with small hills that will put your physical ability to the test. But once you get to the top, trust me, is worth it. As you look around, the views of this magic place blows your socks off. You are able the see all the way to the ocean and Scotland's countryside all at the same time.
