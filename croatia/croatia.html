     <section id="hills"><h2>Greenhills in Dubrovnik, Croatia</h2>

       <p>
         As I was walking down the streets in Dubrovnik, Croatia I was amazed of the beauty of this medieval fortified city. The country was filled with steps taking you up the hill to structures so old but well conserved that was hard to believe they were medieval. No wonder the producers of the Games of Thrones choose Dubrovnik, Croatia as the location to shoot the famous show. This fascinating country not only has amazing scenery but also the most interesting shops and restaurants.

     <section id="borderofcrotia"><h2>The Border of Croatia</h2>

       <p>
         During a tour of the countryside of Croatia, I was brought up a high mountain that was so high up that you could only get to it by cable car. Once you got to top you saw a sight like no other. You could see miles and miles of Croatia in all directions. The coolest part of it was the fact that you could see the border of Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Croatia easily from this place. It was so cool to see how a small dirt road meets these two grand countries together.

     <section id="church"><h2>Church in Dubrovnik, Croatia</h2>

       <p>
         The churches in Croatia are just as amazing as the scenery the country offers. All the churches look like they were taken right out of the medieval times. You are even able to go inside and walk around were some of them house their own museums with preserved old-time attire that the priests would wear during medieval times. The churches were so peaceful. Croatia is a county that you must see. I promise you will not be disappointed.

     <section id="rocks"><h2>Serenity Rocks in Dubrovnik, Croatia</h2>

       <p>
        During a tour of the countryside of Croatia, I looked around and found a sign that said that this area was called the "serenity rocks." People used this area to cleanse their energy and make peace with the earth. It was such a magical experience when I did it and was one of my most memorable moments of the trip.
