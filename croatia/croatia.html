     <section id="hills"><h2>Greenhills in Dubrovnik, Croatia</h2>

       <p>
         As I was walking down the streets in Dubrovnik, Croatia I was breath taken. Everywhere I looked I was taken back by the country's beauty. The country was filled will hilly areas and midevel architect. No wonder the producers of the Games of Thrones chose Dubrovnik, Croatia as the location to shoot the famous show. This fascinating country not only has amazing scenery but also the most interesting shops and resturnast. Croatia is a couny that you must see. I promise you will not be disappointed.

     <section id="borderofcrotia"><h2>The Border of Crotia</h2>

       <p>
      During a tour of the countryside of Croatia, I was brought up a high mountain that was so high up that you could only get to it by cable car. Once you got to top you saw a sight like no other. You could see miles and miles of Croatia in all directions. The coolest part of it all was that fact that I was North is Croatia that you were able to see the border of Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Croatia easily. It was so cool to see how a small dirt road meets these two grand countries together.  IT was such an amazing experience and something that I highly recommend.

     <section id="church"><h2>Church in Dubrovnik, Croatia</h2>

       <p>
         The churches in Croatia are just as amazing as the scenery that the country has to offer. All the churchs look like they were taken right out of the midevel times. The churches were in perfect condition and you are even able to go inside some of the churches and walk around. You are even able to find in some of the churches preserved old-time attire that the priests would wear during that time. The churches were so peaceful when you walked in and breathtaking. The churches in Croatia are definitely a must see when you visit and something you can't miss.

     <section id="rocks"><h2>Serenity Rocks in Dubrovnik, Croatia</h2>

       <p>
        During a tour of the countryside of Croatia, I was brought up a high mountain. Once you got to top you saw a sight like no other. You could see miles and miles of Croatia in all directions. As I walked around the property I found an arena where people were gathered. When I walked up to see what all the people were looking at I saw piles and piles of stacked rocks. The people stacking the rocks in piles in a quiet and peaceful movement. I looked around and found a sign that said that this area was called the "serenity rocks." People used this area to cleanse their energy and make peace with the earth. It was such a magical experience when I did it and was definitely one of my most memorable moments of the trip.
