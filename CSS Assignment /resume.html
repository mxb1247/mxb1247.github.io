    <p>

    <p>
    To whom this may concern,

    I have worked very closely with Michelle Bazinet, both as her supervisor and
    her mentor, while she worked at the Town of Davie Office of the Town Attorney.
    During this time, I have consistently been impressed by the dedicated, prompt, and
    professional manner with which Michelle carried out her work assignments.
    She displayed a high level of understanding and a willingness to learn with
    all of her work assignments. Michelle is attentive to detail and showed my office her
    ability to handle a myriad of tasks.
    Michelle possesses many qualities which I know will make her a successful
    law student and eventual lawyer. She is organized, approaches projects in a
    systematic way, and manages her time efficiently. Michelle's attention to detail was
    instrumental in her success and production of her superior work product while
    working in the Town of Davie. Ms. Bazinet has superior oral and written skills, which
    are vital in the practice of law.
    Ms. Bazinet has shown interest in the field of law and demonstrated the
    needed skills to be an outstanding lawyer. Feel free to contact me if you need further
    information.
   </p>

   <p>
    Sincerely,
   </p>

   <p>
   Allan W einthal, Esq.
