      <section id="marcelle"><h2>Marcelle, France</h2>

        <p>
          When got of the train at Edinburgh, Scotland I started walking and went up the street and saw an unbelievable sight of Edinburgh and at the top of the mountain sat the Edinburgh Castle. This castle was so breath taking that I had to stand for a moment to take it in. Once I got my ticket and entered the castle I felt like I was immediately transported to a scene in Game of Thrones, it was amazing. I had time to explore through the castle and came across the royal jewels exhibit where we saw the kings crown and sword, an incredible experience. I took so many pictures one better than the other and we were filled with gratitude because I this was a once in a life time experience.
