      <section id="londoneye"><h2>London Eye</h2>

        <p>
          The London Eye has always been an iconic landmark that was on my bucket list for years. As you walk you up to the London eye you see a breathtaking structure that is so high up that it hurts your neck to look. Even though going on the London Eye means standing in long lines and pay a steep price to go on it, once you go on it and make it to the top you see a sight like no other. You are able to see miles of London. This landmark is deffently a must do and something you can't miss out.

      <section id="stonehenge"><h2>Stonehenge</h2>

        <p>
          As I saw the stones from the distance, I started getting chills. The place was magical and the view was breathtaking. When I finally arrived at the top of the mountain I could appreciate how the stones were perfectly placed in a circle which makes you wonder about the mystery of Stonehenge and its creation. The feeling of grandiosity and excitement that this site gives you is incredible. Stonehenge is a must do when you are in London, it is defiantly a once in a lifetime opportunity.

      <section id="theater"><h2>Wicked at the London Theater</h2>

        <p>
          Growing up with the movie of the Wizard of Ozz and that being your costume every year in elementary school, you can imagine going to Wicked was definitely a must do when I visited London. Even though the tickets were not cheap, seeing Wicked was definitely a life-changing experience. The actors in the play were unbelievable and even though you have seen Wicked in New York City you sill need to see Wicked, London style.
