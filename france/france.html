      <section id="marcelle"><h2>Marseille, France</h2>

        <p>
          Marseille is a port city in southern France and is one of the prettiest places that you will ever visit. This quaint fisherman town is filled with character and charm and the local people are just as charming as the city. Marseille is also the home of one of the most iconic places in France, Basilique Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde. This beautiful church sits at the top of this hilly the mountains and is a breathtaking view.

      <section id="louvre"><h2>Louvre Museum</h2>

        <p>
          The Louvre Museum is located in Paris, which is the heart of France. This museum is the world's largest art museum and an iconic monument in Paris. This museum is the home of some of the world's most famous paintings and artifacts, such as The Venus de Milo, Leonardo da Vinci, and Egyptian tombs. This museum is so grand that you should expect to spend at least seven hours in there, which is what I did. This place is a must do when visiting Paris and is definitely a life-changing experience.

      <section id="monalisa"><h2>Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum</h2>

        <p>
          The Moana Lisa is on display in one of the world's most famous museums, the Louvre Museum which is located in Paris, France. This painting created by Leonardo da Vinci is one of the most iconic paintings that everyone all around the world recognizes. When going to see the painting I was excited and filled with emotion. It was unbelievable, to see a painting that you always heard about and studied growing up was life-changing. But be prepared when you go to see the painting to wait in line, because trust me you are not the only one going to see this iconic picture.

      <section id="disney"><h2>Disneyland Paris</h2>

        <p>
          Growing up in Florida, the usual family trip every year was a drive to Disney World. Having a love for Disney World, you can only image how excited I was when I found out that there was a Disneyland in Paris. After a hour train ride to get the amusement park from the heart of Paris, I was eager to get inside. As you walk in the gate you feel like you are transported back to the Disney World in Orlando, Florida. It was so weird, everything looked exactly the same down to the detail. But the only difference is that everything that you heard was in French. Even the rides looked the same, except when the rides audio started announcing in French. It was such a unique experience and something I highly recommend for any Disney lovers.
